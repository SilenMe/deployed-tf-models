this model predict the output for 10 acc to the rules input=[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    and output=[-3.0, -1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0]
    it it basically y=2x-1, so output should be 19 or approx 19 because of ml model
    got to the site https://silenme.github.io/deployed-tf-models/p1/firstHTML.html wait for sometime to get the popup with result for 10
