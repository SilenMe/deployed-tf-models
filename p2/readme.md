this is a hand digit recogniton model which will idntify the digits between 0-9, note that is is browseer based so it will take some time to load, also due to less training due to browser limitation
sometimes it gets confused specially when drawn 8. look th site here https://silenme.github.io/deployed-tf-models/p2/mnist.html
