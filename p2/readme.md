this is a hand digit recognition model that will identify the digits between 0-9, note that is browser-based so it will take some time to load, also due to less training due to browser limitation sometimes it gets confused especially when drawn 8. look the site here https://silenme.github.io/deployed-tf-models/p2/mnist.html
